"Inco Ltd's huge nickel, copper and cobalt property at Voisey's Bay in remote Labrador keeps getting bigger, with 11 drill rigs working around the clock to define three enormous deposits that promise to upset the world's metals markets.

Canada's biggest gold companies, Barrick Gold Corp. and Placer Dome Inc. have followed suit	12	12	\HeatherScoffield	\HeatherScoffield
Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd., moved on Monday to resolve a dispute over its huge Busang gold discovery in Indonesia, forging an alliance with a company controlled by the eldest son of Indonesia's President Suharto	12	12	\HeatherScoffield	\HeatherScoffield
At the Ovoid deposit, found close to the surface of a bog close to the Labrador Sea, drilling has outlined 37.5 million tonnes. Exploration is finished at the Ovoid and Inco now plans to mine the area through an open pit mine.  The Eastern Deeps, which lies under a series of hills covered with sparse trees and lush moss, has not yet been defined	12	12	\HeatherScoffield	\HeatherScoffield
Barrick has demonstrated its interest in Indonesian gold by investing more than US$10 million in exploration and amassing a large land position in Indonesia, analysts said.  And Barrick's association with a construction company run by the daughter of Indonesia's President Suharto suggests Barrick is carefully setting up its network to control a piece or all of the Busang, Bre-X's 47-million-ounce discovery in the middle of the jungles of Borneo	12	12	\HeatherScoffield	\HeatherScoffield
The Indonesian government has vowed not to issue essential contracts of work until Bre-X sorts out its problems. The alliance with Panutan is also contingent on Bre-X receiving the permits	12	12	\HeatherScoffield	\HeatherScoffield

Shareholders are troubled about negotiations between Barrick Gold Corp and Bre-X Minerals Ltd over the huge Busang gold deposit in Indonesia	12	12	\HeatherScoffield	\HeatherScoffield
"""At the end of the day, I believe Barrick will be fair,"" said Fowler. Barrick has an international reputation to uphold and could face lawsuits from Bre-X shareholders if it tries to undermine Bre-X. Barrick may buy part of Busang and act as operator, rather than bidding for Bre-X, analysts said"	12	12	\HeatherScoffield	\HeatherScoffield
Analysts have speculated that Barrick used its business connections with Suharto's eldest daughter, as well as connections through former U.S. President George Bush and former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Barrick advisers, to sway the Indonesian government	12	12	\HeatherScoffield	\HeatherScoffield

"""The one thing I've learned is it's impossible to predict nickel prices,"" he said"	12	12	\HeatherScoffield	\HeatherScoffield
In the near term, Inco said its production should grow in 1997 to 430 million pounds, up from 415 million in 1996. By 1998, nickel production should reach 450 million pounds, the company said	12	12	\HeatherScoffield	\HeatherScoffield

The Indonesian government told Reuters in Jakarta Monday that the two companies had agreed to split the deposit, with Barrick getting 75 percent and Bre-X keeping 25 percent	12	12	\HeatherScoffield	\HeatherScoffield

The threat of a lawsuit gives Bre-X a strong incentive to settle with Krueng Gasui and Indonesian businessman Jusuf Merukh, who controls Krueng Gasui, said gold analyst Catherine Gignac of Deacon Capital	12	12	\HeatherScoffield	\HeatherScoffield

In 1995, Barrick -- already North America's largest gold miner -- produced 3.1 million ounces of gold and had gold reserves totalling 43.3 million ounces	12	12	\HeatherScoffield	\HeatherScoffield

""We've got roads, workforce, cheap power and reliable workers. It can really help to keep the cost down.""But new technology has been the biggest boost for exploration in Timmins.

Merrill Lynch analyst David Christensen predicted that U.S. gold firm Homestake Mining Co.'s earnings for the year would drop to about 13 cents a share if gold averaged $370. Homestake would earn 22 cents a share at a gold price of $385.  Companies that do not hedge their gold sales -- such as Homestake, Echo Bay Mines Ltd., Battle Mountain Gold Co. and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. -- were especially vulnerable, Christensen said.

They argue the FCC overstepped the power granted to it by Congress. The FCC, among other things, ordered the regional Bells and other local phone companies to lease their lines to new rivals at discounts of 17 percent to 25 percent	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Last week, the FBI opened an investigation into the taping and leaking of a telephone conference call between Gingrich and his top lieutenants. The probe came after a Florida couple said they  delivered a tape of the cellular phone conversation to the senior Democrat on the House Ethics Committee	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
A string of mergers among the seven Bells, meanwhile, has narrowed the number of potential competitors in the phone business, with Bell Atlantic Corp. acquiring NYNEX and SBC Communications Inc. buying Pacific Telesis Group	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
But parental groups, children's advocates, educators and some key lawmakers -- including Rep. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat -- have demanded that the group include a content-based system specifying the level of sex, violence and bad language	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"""For many years, the Michigan Public Service Commission has supported allowing expanded choice for telephone customers,"" said commission Chairman John Strand"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Not so fast, argue TV manufacturers	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
It will be similar to the 28-year-old system of letters and numbers used by the motion-picture industry and which includes the ratings G, PG, PG-13, R and NC-17	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
While the accounting rates paid by both carriers are about equal, the imbalance reflects the fact that many more overseas calls are made from the United States than into this country	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"""Our comments today are designed to assist the Federal Communications Commission to follow a course that will introduce more competition in the telecommunications marketplace.""After filing its initial request with the FCC, Ameritech was forced to amend its application with an additional 1,500 pages of documents.

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt, speaking a day after a liquor industry group said it would end its own voluntary ban on radio and TV promotions, also said he had no immediate plans to issue rules to block such ads	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
The NAB supports an FCC plan for an approximately 15-year transition to digital broadcasts	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Lawyers said that while a court could rule against the FCC on smaller aspects of the interconnection rules, the heart of the rules should remain unscathed.  Still, lawyers hedged their bets and said it was possible that the FCC could lose and that the legal challengers could pull a rabbit out of the hat and have the rules overturned	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
The panel, established by the new telecommunications law, is scheduled to unveil its plans Thursday. Several issues are at stake, some of which were unresolved at the last minute	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
The rules were frozen while the appeals court considers a challenge to the FCC order by GTE Corp., the so-called Baby Bell phone companies, other local carriers and state regulators who want the measure overturned	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Lawyers and industry officials agree that even though the FCC rules are suspended, their influence still lingers	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
But some board members fear the plan -- to be paid for from the revenues of phone companies, cable TV operators and other communications carriers -- may prove too ambitious and ultimately push up rates	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Ameritech Corp. Thursday became the first Baby Bell phone company to seek federal approval under the new telecommunications law to offer long-distance service from its regional calling area	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
TV officials said it was too soon to judge	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion

The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in St. Louis, issued its stay on Oct. 15 while it considers a challenge to the rules, which spell out how long-distance carriers, cable-TV operators and others can link up to the local phone market under the new telecommunications law. Oral arguments are set for January	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Next was a unit of long-distance giant AT&amp;T Corp., which bid $407 million for 222 licenses in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere. The licenses cover 139 million people. AT&amp;T was followed by a unit of BellSouth Corp., which bid $205 million for 39 licenses reaching nearly 12 million people in the Southeast	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"""It literally has the potential of saving consumers billions of dollars,"" said Scott Harris, an attorney with Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
The split among commissioners has stymied action for now	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"Scott Cleland of Schwab Washington Research Group agreed: ""The timetable people had for this bill was overly ambitious.""The Telecommunications Act of 1996, enacted on February 8, ripped down 62-year-old legal barriers and encouraged local and long-distance carriers, cable-TV operators, electric utilities and others to invade each other's backyards"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
That, in turn, could delay the Baby Bells' entrance into the $70 billion long-distance market. The telecommunications law enacted in February lets the Bells offer long-distance only after they have opened their own markets to new rivals	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"""It's phenomenally cheaper,"" said Jonathan Foxman, vice president of Americall International, a Phoenix-based PCS firm that bid at the auction"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion

The union earlier had said it would offer a new pay proposal -- probably less than the 11.5 percent over four years it had sought. The latest reported offer from American was a six percent boost over four years	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
FCC Chairman Hundt says the courts, regulators and lawmakers must resist industry efforts to stifle competition	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"""There will be concern from countries around the world with the benchmark item. There's no doubt about that,"" said the FCC's Gips"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Q: What's been the public's reaction?A: Mixed. The ratings have drawn flak from some lawmakers, parent groups, children's advocates, educators and others. These groups say the new system does not go far enough	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
FCC officials have yet to decide how to handle the Alaska request, which was submitted last month but drew little notice. They also have not yet decided how to respond to a recent bipartisan request from 26 members of Congress asking the FCC to open a formal investigation into broadcast liquor ads	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Going into the talks on Thursday evening, Kenneth Hipp, chairman of the National Mediation Board, said he was hopeful an agreement could be worked out in time to avert a strike	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Estimates range anywhere from $4 billion to $12 billion a year. It could influence what consumers and businesses pay for their phone bills	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
The Federal Communications Commission is expected to curb its power to approve or reject long-distance rates by ending a Depression-era rule requiring telephone carriers to notify the FCC before rate changes	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
A number of phone companies, including several regional Baby Bell companies, have asked the FCC for just one broad category that would give them greater marketing flexibility	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Meanwhile, Gore aide Greg Simon told reporters that the administration is sticking by its proposal for an expedited auction of analog spectrum that will be returned by television broadcasters during the transition to digital TV	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Analysts also said the wireless market was getting crowded with companies holding PCS and traditional cellular licenses -- meaning less profits	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
But the plan could rub governments the wrong way. High rates charged by their own phone monopolies can be used to maintain bloated payrolls or to subsidize local phone service	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
A federal mediator refereeing the talks at a downtown hotel informed the pilots that American had rejected a key union contract proposal covering who should pilot -- and at what pay -- the carrier's smaller American Eagle planes	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
They also fear an explosion in telemarketing: Companies could use CPNI to market a vast array of products and services unrelated to the phone service a customer actually receives	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"""Those few countries trying to defend their monopolies are going to be nervous"" about the FCC effort, said Dan Rosen of the Institute for International Economics"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Because no scanning format was specified, the computer industry will be free to manufacture computers that use just progressive scanning. And TV manufacturers are ready to make sets that offer both interlace and progressive technology	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
The average license price tumbled more than 90 percent	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"The steep prices at last year's PCS auction meant less money available this time around. ""The latest prices are an indication that people have run out of money,"" said Bane"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
The FCC actions come as the United States is seeking to open overseas telecommunications markets through talks sponsored by the World Trade Organisation	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Long-distance carriers AT&amp;T Corp. and MCI Communications Corp. among other companies, also asked the high court on Thursday to lift the stay	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion

The FCC has proposed to classify phone service under three categories: local, long distance and cellular. CPNI from one could not be used to market another without a customer's okay	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
But consumer and privacy groups fear the data could fall into the wrong hands without tough curbs and clear approval	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion

The union had proposed that its pilots fly the American Eagle flights, but with lower pay than pilots flying the regular American aircraft. American, however, wants to continue using lower-paid commuter pilots from a different union to fly the smaller planes	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
But industry officials and consumer advocates argued the new approach will lead to consumer confusion and make it tougher for consumers to get the best possible deals	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
The initial FCC proposal stemmed from a recommendation by an advisory panel that included representatives from the entertainment, broadcast, electronic and computer industries. The plan took more than eight years to develop	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
American Airlines Chairman Robert Crandall called for binding government arbitration of the dispute, a proposal the pilots have repeatedly rejected	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Overriding the objections of some regulators, the board proposed to fund the federal program through the interstate and intrastate revenues of telecommunications carriers	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"The HBO system, developed in the mid-80s, offers ratings such as ""MV"" for ""mild violence,"" ""SC"" for ""strong sexual content"" and ""AL"" for ""adult language.""But Valenti said that system is unworkable and is too complicated to appear in TV listings in the newspaper"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion

"Mediators are shuttling back and forth between the two sides offering hypothetical ""what if"" proposals on a variety of issues in an effort the bring the two sides closer together and prevent a midnight Friday (0500 GMT Saturday) strike by the pilots which would throw the nation's air transport system into turmoil"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"Once the ratings are implemented in January, Valenti did say the industry would revisit the system after about a year to determine whether it should be changed or ""tweaked.""""Is it perfect? Of course not. All subjective systems are flawed. So is ours,"" Valenti said"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"""This figure would drop in half overnight if American carriers simply paid fees even vaguely related to costs,"" FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said in a recent speech. He noted that the imbalance dwarfs the U.S. foreign aid budget of $2 billion"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
That ad campaign has unleashed criticism from lawmakers, regulators and President Clinton. And the latest decision is sure to rachet up the debate	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"""Those few countries trying to defend their monopolies are going to be nervous"" about the FCC effort, said Dan Rosen of the Institute for International Economics"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Lawyers and government officials said the basis of the dispute stems from the Clinton administration's objection to allowing a Canadian satellite to beam programmes into the United States -- while U.S. companies cannot enjoy the same rights to broadcast into Canada	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
TV-14 -- Parents of children under 14 strongly cautioned	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion

"""It is clear that the industry has so far failed to respond adequately to the fundamental interest of parents in knowing the specific content of TV shows in advance,"" Markey said at a news conference accompanied by other lawmakers and groups pushing for a content-based system like the one now used by the HBO cable channel"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"Deputy Assistant Attorney General Robert Litt suggested to lawmakers they explore ""whether it continues to make sense"" to levy different penalties for eavesdropping on the different types of calls"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
A number of groups representing lawmakers, parents, children's advocates, educators and others believe this system is too vague and advocate a content-based system that would specify violence, sex and strong language, using letters such as V, S and L	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
What's more, long-distance carriers such as AT&amp;T are not now sounding alarm bells	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
But in the case of wireless calls in particular, the law is little enforced and penalties are light because cellular traffic is so easily intercepted	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
The FCC sold 1,479 PCS licenses nationwide in three different blocks, making this the most licenses sold at once. A third were reserved for small companies. Markets that generated the highest bidding were New York, Chicago and Los Angeles	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Operators over the lowest spectrum band will be restricted to indoor use. Users of the middle band will be able to operate over a wider area, such as a college campus.

Americans spend about 16 cents a minute for a domestic call. But they must shell out an average of 99 cents a minute to call overseas -- even though the cost of the calls are not much different, according to FCC officials	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Q: What are prime-time shows likely to receive?A: Networks expect most will carry a middle-of-the-road TV-PG. But a show's rating can vary from episode to episode	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion

Federal law makes it a crime to intentionally intercept or disclose the contents of a telephone call, regardeless of whether it is over a hard-wired, cellular or cordless phone	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Few curbs existed before the new telecom law. The new FCC rules -- which stem from a provision in the law pushed by Representative Edward Markey, D-Mass., -- are expected in early 1997	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"But not every detail is spelled out. Under the industry compromise, the standard does not specify the video format by which images will be put onto the screen, or ""scanned.""Broadcasters and TV manufacturers had wanted to require a format known as ""interlace"" scanning. Computer companies argued that would stifle the convergence of TV and computer technologies. They wanted to mandate ""progressive"" scanning, which is better suited to computers, or no format at all"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
To cut rates and open markets, the FCC is adopting a carrot-and-stick approach. Tuesday's order is meant for open markets, such as those in Britain, Canada and Chile	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Markey expressed support for closing the necessary loopholes to make it tougher for scanner operators to illegally tap in on cellular calls	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Long-distance giants AT&amp;T Corp. and MCI Communications Corp. called on the FCC to reject the move, saying Ameritech has not yet opened its local phone market	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"Consumer advocates also objected. ""Today's decision by DISCUS to dump its voluntary ban marks the beginning of an open liquor-marketing season on America's children and teens,"" said George Hacker of the Center for Science in the Public Interest"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
The existing rules require overseas companies to turn over their long-distance calls to U.S. carriers in the same proportion U.S. carriers send calls to a foreign carrier's home market	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
If AT&amp;T, for example, accounts for 60 percent of calls to a country, then that country's monopoly must hand off 60 percent of its U.S.-bound calls to AT&amp;T	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"The rating are to be used in conjunction with a ""V-chip"" installed in TV sets that allow parents to block out shows they consider too violent or racy"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Overriding the objections of some regulators, the board proposed to fund the federal programme through the interstate and intrastate revenues of telecommunications carriers	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
In other areas, the board left many key provisions of its proposals vague, including the cost of the federal fund that would be used to subsidize carriers that offer phone service in high-cost rural areas and in low-income neighborhoods	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
The agency must decide what form of customer approval a carrier must receive before using the data for marketing	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"To reduce the rates, the FCC proposal scheduled for next month would set ""benchmark"" rates for what U.S. carriers could pay foreign carriers to complete calls. These rates, according to FCC officials, would better reflect actual costs"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Based on the population sizes covered by the licenses, the average bid at the auction was just $3.32 a person	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
That checklist was spelled out under last year's big communications law as a condition for local carriers to offer long-distance service from their regions	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
State regulators, not the FCC, are calling many of the shots over how to open the local market to competition from the likes of long-distance carriers such as AT&amp;T Corp, cable-TV operators, utilities and other companies	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
The drop reflected the flood of new entrants into the wireless phone market, a dearth of new money after the sky-high prices paid at last year's PCS sale, and the smaller slice of airwaves covered by the new licenses, analysts said	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"""This decision is disappointing for parents, and dangerous for our kids,"" said FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, whose agency has begun a probe of the ad campaign"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
The FCC and the long-distance companies had told the high court the stay ran counter to the telecom law and would hurt consumers by delaying the introduction of competition in the local market	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"Markey told a news conference it would be ""very unfortunate"" if the TV industry ignored the survey results and did not incorporate the kind of system used by the Home Box Office cable-TV movie channel to rate its shows. Each HBO show is given a rating based on content such as ""MV"" for ""mild violence"" or ""SC"" for ""strong sexual content.""Markey vowed the groups sponsoring the poll would ""scream to the high heavens"" if the TV ratings ignored program content"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
"The states do, however, appear to be taking account of the FCC's now-defunct rules governing the prices new entrants to the local business must pay to acess the existing network controlled by the Baby Bells and other local carriers.  FCC Chairman Reed Hundt -- who last month charged that an appeals court order suspending the FCC rules amounted to a ""monkey wrench"" in the  deregulation process -- now sees matters differently. ""I'm pretty encouraged as of this moment about the general trend here,"" he said last Friday"	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion

The government's largest wireless phone auction ended Tuesday, with prices taking a U-turn back toward earth after 125 companies bid a total of $2.5 billion to offer a new generation of cellular service	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
The new approach represents the first major step the FCC has taken under a provision of the new telecommunications law allowing it to shed outdated rules if the public interest is not harmed	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
Thanks to the appeals court order, state regulators are responsible for deciding important pricing issues. The FCC rules prescibed standardized prices for all 50 states	40	40	\RogerFillion	\RogerFillion
